# Excel Kickstarter Analysis

### Summary | GRADE: A
In this project, I was given a starter file containing information on various Kickstarted campaigns. Using conditional formatting and Excel's built-in tools such as pivot tables and graphs, I derived new insights from the data set.

### Questions for Analysis
#### Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?

1.	In this sample, the Theater category, and Plays specifically, had the highest number of Kickstarter campaigns by far. In terms of outcomes, more than half were successful, but even the failed theater campaigns outnumber the total number of campaigns in any other category. This trend holds among most all countries with a sample size of 25 or more projects. 
2.	Music was the second-most pursued campaign category. Interestingly, one hundred percent of Rock campaigns were successful. Combined with the point above, these suggest that those that engage in Kickstarter campaigns, as well as those that back them, prefer projects that can generally be put in the broader category of Arts & Culture.
3.	As a general trend, campaigns that set a higher goal for the number f backers tended to fare worse off. As the goal gets higher, success drops quite dramatically, from over 70 percent successful for the smallest campaigns to under 20 percent for the largest campaigns. This could be suggestive of a couple of things. It may be difficult to attract large numbers of backers for Kickstarter campaigns in general. It may also be that more ambitious campaigns over promise on what is actually needed as an upfront investment to get their project off the ground. It is easy to imagine a campaign that promises to be revolutionary, but the technology isn’t quite advanced enough for eventual market sale.

#### What are some limitations of this dataset?

First of all, this data set is a random sample of all Kickstarter campaigns, so the full data set may portray a different picture that hat can be gathered here. More importantly, it is important not to draw any broader conclusions about entrepreneurship or innovations from Kickstarter data alone. Kickstarter is a great platform for creating interesting ideas and products, but it can’t tell us all that much about hat people actually want or need beyond what is interesting to them. Kickstarter may be prone to more flashy and innovative ideas, so as to attract more backers, but it doesn’t give a wider window into general innovation and how it might impact peoples’ lives.

#### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

One chart that would be interesting is the average donation by category and sub-category. I hypothesize that the Tech category has the highest average donation based on the ambitiousness of those projects, the crowded market for such projects, and the incomes of people donating to those campaigns, but I would like to see that data there. 

I would also like to use the Staff Pick and Spotlight columns to see if there is a significant difference in outcomes for those that were highlighted by the Kickstarter platform.

#### Bonus: Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median summarizes the data more meaningfully.

In this case, the median is a more useful measure of central tendency for these data sets. This is because, using a back-of-the-envelope 1.5 IQR test, there are a significant number of outliers in both directions. Since the mean weights outliers heavily, median is more appropriate in this case. 

#### Bonus: Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?

According to the calculations done here, successful campaigns have a much higher variance than unsuccessful campaigns. This would make sense given that many unsuccessful campaigns have no backers, which is much close to the median number of backers than the successful campaigns which have a wider range of backers.
